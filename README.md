# Guess the Word!

Are you tired of Wordle? Want something more than just five empty boxes, but still love the thrill of guessing words?

THIS IS THE GAME FOR YOU!

## How to Play

Currently, this game runs through GitHub Pages at https://oliverijoe.github.io/guess-the-word/

Once you have it cooking in your browser, it's time to play!

The number of dots are the placeholders for the letters of the mystery word that has been generated from a word bank API (thank you to my coding school, Skillcrush!).

You have 8 guesses (as displayed) to fill in the dots of the mystery word.

Guess a letter by entering one letter (lowercase or uppercase) into the box and click "Guess!".

Once you've either won (yay!) or loss, the game will end and you can choose to play a new one!

## Rules of the Game

Make sure to only guess A-Z letters. Numbers and symbols will return a warning for you to stay on the right track.

Make sure to not guess the same letter you've already tried. If so, another warning will pop up. You will have a letter bank of all your failed guesses to help you out.

## Enjoy!
